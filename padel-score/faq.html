    <h2>How do I start a new match on the Padel Score Mini app?</h2>
    <p>
        To start a new match on the Padel Score Mini app, open the app on your Apple Watch and you will see the "New

    <h2>How does the app determine the match winner?</h2>
    <p>The app uses the standard rules of Padel to determine the match winner.
        In a typical match, the team that wins six games with a two-game lead over their opponent wins the set.
        If the score reaches 6-6, a tie-break is played to determine the winner.

        The app will automatically keep track of the score and determine the winner based on these rules.
